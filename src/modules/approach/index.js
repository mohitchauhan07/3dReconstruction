              The models takes 6 images from two consecutive timestamp and predicts the Global 6-DoF camera pose and difference in the poses.
              For training, the images captured from 3 different cameras and extract corresponding pose from Lego-LOAM.
              Further the model exported into TensorRT.
              Indoor Food Court data is collected from OttonomyIO bot.
              The data is collected from 3 cameras at 10 Hz. 
              The data is collected from 3 cameras at 10 Hz. The camera is setup in such a way that they cover 360Â°.
              Lidar point cloud captured for calculating the poses.
              To extract the pose for training from Lidar point cloud we used Lego-LOAM.
              Captured more than 5000 images.`
